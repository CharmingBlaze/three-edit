# Three-Edit Library Overview

**Three-Edit** is a comprehensive, modular 3D mesh editing library designed specifically for Three.js applications. It provides a complete toolkit for creating, manipulating, and managing 3D geometry in a structured and efficient manner.

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture Overview

Three-Edit is built with a modular architecture that separates concerns and allows for selective usage of features. The library is completely headless, meaning it doesn't depend on any specific rendering or UI framework, making it perfect for integration into existing Three.js applications.

### Core Design Principles
