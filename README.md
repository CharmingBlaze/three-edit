## âœ¨ Features

- **Modular Architecture**: The library is designed to be modular, allowing you to use only the parts you need.
- **Headless by Design**: three-edit is completely headless, meaning it doesn't rely on any specific rendering or UI framework.

## ðŸ“¦ Installation

To install three-edit, you can use npm or yarn:

```bash
npm install three-edit
```

```bash
yarn add three-edit
```

## ðŸš€ Getting Started

Here's a simple example of how to create a cube and convert it to a Three.js BufferGeometry:

```typescript
import { createCube } from 'three-edit';
import { toBufferGeometry } from 'three-edit';
import * as THREE from 'three';

// Create a new cube
const cube = createCube();

// Convert the cube to a Three.js BufferGeometry
const geometry = toBufferGeometry(cube);

// Create a new Three.js mesh
const material = new THREE.MeshBasicMaterial({ color: 0x00ff00 });
const mesh = new THREE.Mesh(geometry, material);

// Add the mesh to your scene
scene.add(mesh);
```
